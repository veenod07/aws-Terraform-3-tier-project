USE:

**terraform init**
Initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. It downloads the required provider plugins and sets up the backend if specified.

**terraform plan**
Creates an execution plan showing what actions Terraform will take to change the infrastructure. It compares the current infrastructure state with the configuration to determine what needs to be created, updated, or destroyed.

**terraform validate**
Checks whether the configuration is valid without actually deploying resources.

**terraform apply**
Applies the changes required to reach the desired state as defined by the Terraform configuration files.

**terraform destroy**
Destroys all the resources defined in the configuration files.
